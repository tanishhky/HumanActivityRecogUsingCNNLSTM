# Advanced Human Activity Recognition and Anomaly Detection Using Hybrid CNN-LSTM and Autoencoders

## Abstract
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in various applications such as healthcare, fitness monitoring, and human-computer interaction. This project addresses the challenge of accurately classifying activities using smartphone sensor data while incorporating anomaly detection to identify irregular patterns. Leveraging the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset, we propose a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dependency modeling. Additionally, an Autoencoder is integrated to detect anomalies based on reconstruction errors.


The hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of XX.XX%, demonstrating its capability to handle complex activity patterns. The Autoencoder successfully flagged anomalies with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of YY.YY. Extensive experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of hyperparameters, dropout rates, and optimizers on model performance. The proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in both classification and anomaly detection, making it a robust solution for real-world applications.

## Background and Literature Review
Human Activity Recognition is a critical component of applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and elder care. Traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), often fail to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in sensor data. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated the efficacy of CNNs and LSTMs for HAR tasks.

Anomaly detection, another important aspect of HAR, has traditionally relied on statistical models or clustering techniques. Autoencoders have emerged as a promising solution for detecting deviations in data distributions. This project combines CNN-LSTM for classification with Autoencoders for anomaly detection.

## Introduction
Human Activity Recognition involves identifying a person's physical actions from sensor data. Accurate HAR is crucial for applications in healthcare, fitness monitoring, and safety systems. Challenges include:
- Complexity of Sensor Data: Raw sensor data contains noise and variations.
- Temporal Dependencies: Activities exhibit temporal patterns that are difficult to capture with traditional models.
- Data Imbalance: Some activities occur more frequently, leading to imbalanced datasets.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying irregular patterns in dynamic, high-dimensional data is non-trivial.

This project proposes a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to combine spatial and temporal feature extraction for HAR. An Autoencoder is integrated for anomaly detection, ensuring robust and accurate recognition even in the presence of irregularities.
